A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In this chapter we will have a look at one of the easiest way of sharing data between your widgets, using an InheritedWidget. An InheritedWidget is a ProxyWidget which in turn is a Widget and with a constant constructor, allows you to share data between your child and your child's children!
