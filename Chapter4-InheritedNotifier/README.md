# testinginheritednotifier_course

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In this chapter we talk about ChangeNotifier and how you can wrap your state and value changes inside an instance of ChangeNotifier. Then to consume your changes you can use an InheritedNotifier that has a "notifier" which is your change notifier and a "child" which can be anything. We will also look at why it is important to use a Builder inside our InheritedNotifier to get hold of the inherited notifier itself.
