# MobX Reactive State Management

MobX is a reactive state management solution that is available for both Dart and Flutter. The Dart part of the MobX package gives us observables, computed properties, and actions plus reactions. The Flutter MobX package allows us to integrate MobX into our Flutter applications by giving us Observer, a StatefulWidget that can listen to changes occurring in a Store object and returning a Widget that matches the current state.

## Getting Started

Each step of the course is in its own tag and commit so either check the various commits out or go to various tags.

I have deleted the Firebase project backing this app for security reasons so before you get started, set up your firebase backend as shown in the course (https://youtu.be/7Od55PBxYkI)
